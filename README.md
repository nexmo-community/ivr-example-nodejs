This is a small demo application for building an IVR with DTMF to book an appointment with node.js. Once the user confirms on a call, they are sent an SMS with the details

# Usage

* Register a Nexmo application
* Purchase a number and associate that number with your application
* Populate API key/secret, application ID and make sure that `private.key` exists at the same level as `index.js`
* Update the event URL to be your server
* Run index.js then call your number
